Macaulay2 code to extend the functionality of https://s2.smu.edu/doems/ for any number of dimensions over a finite field. This code was written during the Summer of 2020 in pursuit of necessary and sufficient conditions of unique reduced Groebner Bases with respect to any monomial ordering of ideals generated from  affine varieties of finite fields under Professor Elena Dimitrova.

Also thank you to the NSF, as this work was partially supported by the NSF award DMS-1419038 and paid for my work in the summer 2020.

Instructions on how to run this code can be found at the bottom of the AnyuTable.m2 file.
