# GroebnerBasesResearch2020
Macaulay2 code to extend the functionality of https://s2.smu.edu/doems/ for any number of dimension over a field of any positive characteristic. This code was written during the Summer of 2020 in pursuit of necessary and sufficient conditions of unique reduced Groebner Bases with respect to any monomial ordering of ideals generated from  affine varieties of finite fields under Professor Elena Dimitrova.

Instructions on how to run this code can be found at the bottom of the AnyuTable.m2 file.
